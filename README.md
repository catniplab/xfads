Approximate inference targeted at variational Gaussian state-space models with dense covariance matrix approximations.  For more details, see our paper: [Dowling, Zhao, Park. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01371) \[7\]


## Introduction
A LowRankNonlinearStateSpaceModel object is used to perform inference in a state-space graphical model specified by,

$$p(y_{1:T}, z_{1:T}) = p_{\theta}(z_1) p(y_1 | z_1) \prod p_{\psi}(y_t | z_t) p_{\theta}(z_t | z_{t-1})$$
where
$$p_{\theta}(z_1) = N(m_0, Q_0)$$
$$p_{\theta}(z_t | z_{t-1}) = N(m_{\theta}(z_{t-1}), Q)$$

Specification of a LowRankNonlinearStateSpaceModel requires:

1. dynamics_mod: a nn.Module with a `mean_fn` attribute that specifies $m_{\theta}(\cdot)$ (e.g. some neural network function) 
2. initial_c_pdf: a nn.Module that specifies the initial mean, $m_0$, and initial state-noise $Q_0$
3. likelihood_pdf: a nn.Module that implements a `get_ell(y, z)` method that returns $\log p_{\psi}(y|z)$
4. local_encoder: a nn.Module whose `forward` function maps time-instantaneous observations, $y_t$, to a natural parameter update, $\alpha_t$
5. backward_encoder: a nn.Module whose `forward` function maps sequences of local natural parameter updates, $\alpha_{1:T}$, to backward natural parameter updates, $\beta_{1:T}$
6. nl_filter: a nn.Module whose forward method takes natural parameter representation of observations, $\tilde{\lambda}_{1:T}$, and performs approximate posterior inference for the specified nonlinear dynamical system

## Parameter descriptions
There are several parameters that can be configured to trade off expressivity/speed/generalization properties of the model and inference algorithm that we detail below.  Some are specific to the case of neural data modeled using a Poisson observation model with log-linear readout of the latent state.

1. n_latents: (int) total number of latent variables
2. n_latents_read: (int) total number of latent variables accessed by the observation model
3. rank_local: (int) the rank of the local precision update -- $A(y_t) A(y_t)^{\top}$
4. rank_backward: (int) the rank of the backward precision update -- $B(\alpha_{t+1:T}) B(\alpha_{t+1:T})^{\top}$
5. p_mask_a: (float) the probability of setting $\alpha_t$ to $0$
6. p_mask_b: (float) the probability of setting $\beta_t$ to $0$
7. p_mask_apb: (float) the probability of setting $\tilde{\lambda}_t = \alpha_t + \beta_t$ to $0$
8. p_mask_y_in: (float) the probability of masking data fed as input to the inference networks
9. use_cd: (bool) whether to use the coordinated dropout technique of [Keshtkaran and Pandarinath, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07896) \[4\] -- in which case `p_mask_y_in` specifies the coordinated dropout rate

Setting `p_mask_a` is equivalent to masking *actual* observations, $y_t$; this strategy was used in the context of structured VAE's for linear dynamical systems in [Zhao, and Linderman. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16543) \[5\] to promote learning dynamics more adept at prediction (and thus generating more realistic data).  Setting `p_mask_b` is equivalent to masking `pseudo` observations, $\tilde{y}_t$ -- this helps to regularize both the local/backward encoders required.

## Installation
1. Install miniconda or anaconda
This is just to leverage `conda` for managing the Python environment. You can still use the IDE or code editor of your choice.
2. Clone this repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/catniplab/xfads
   ```
3. Create a Conda environment, and install its required packages, from `environment.yaml`
   Make sure you are in the project directory i.e., the same directory as `environment.yaml`, and run:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
5. Add the `xfads` package to the `PYTHONPATH` of the environment
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```
Note:
In the case of using Google Colab, to be able to use ```conda``` commands, you have to install ```condacolab```\
In a cell, run:
```
!pip install -q condacolab
```
But since Colab uses sessions anyway, it won't be that useful to use an environment. You can just start a new Colab session, and run, in a cell:
```
!pip install torch pytorch-lightning scikit-learn hydra-core matplotlib einops
!pip install pyproject.toml -e .
```

## Getting started with the examples:
The set of examples in this codebase covers the primary functioning of the graphical state-space model of XFADS. The code is structured in a modular way that allows the users to change and plug in their own definitions of the classes that structure the elements of the model, i.e. the dynamics function, the likelihood density, the amortization network, etc.


## Walk-through
Now, for simplicity, and to get a grasp of the wheel, it's recommended to go through the examples of applying XFADS to some of the benchmarking datasets, before reconfiguring for yours.
- `lda_example` A simple linear dynamical system.
- `vdp_example` Adding a bit of non-linearity; training XFADS on data synthesized from the Vanderpool dynamical oscillator.
Then, some real experimental data:
- `monkey_reaching` Approximating the posterior of the latents and inferring the underlying dynamics of the `mc_maze` dataset.
- `monkey_timing` similarly, for the `dmfc_rsg` dataset.
  

## Example configuration
LSVS was designed with custom configurations in mind so that depending on the problem, `dynamics_mod`, `initial_c_pdf`, `likelihood_pdf`, `local_encoder`, and `backward_encoder` can be configured as desired.  We include some general classes in `ssm_modules/encoders`, `ssm_modules/likelihoods`, and `ssm_modules/dynamics` that should be sufficient for a wide range of problems.  Below is an example configuration.
```
    """likelihood pdf"""
    C = torch.nn.Linear(cfg.n_latents, n_neurons_obs, device=cfg.device)
    likelihood_pdf = PoissonLikelihood(C, n_neurons_obs, cfg.bin_sz, device=cfg.device)

    """dynamics module"""
    Q = torch.ones(cfg.n_latents, device=cfg.device)
    dynamics_fn = utils.build_gru_dynamics_function(cfg.n_latents, cfg.n_hidden_dynamics, device=cfg.device)
    dynamics_mod = DenseGaussianNonlinearDynamics(dynamics_fn, cfg.n_latents, Q, device=cfg.device)

    """initial condition"""
    Q0 = torch.ones(cfg.n_latents, device=cfg.device)
    m0 = torch.zeros(cfg.n_latents, device=cfg.device)
    initial_condition_pdf = DenseGaussianInitialCondition(cfg.n_latents, m0, Q0, device=cfg.device)

    """local/backward encoder"""
    backward_encoder = BackwardEncoderLRMvn(cfg.n_latents_read, cfg.n_hidden_backward, cfg.n_latents, cfg.rank_local,
                                            cfg.rank_backward, device=cfg.device)
    local_encoder = LocalEncoderLRMvn(cfg.n_latents, n_neurons_enc, cfg.n_hidden_local, cfg.n_latents,
                                      cfg.rank_local, device=cfg.device, dropout=cfg.p_local_dropout)
    nl_filter = NonlinearFilter(dynamics_mod, initial_condition_pdf, device=cfg.device)

    """sequence vae"""
    ssm = LowRankNonlinearStateSpaceModel(dynamics_mod, likelihood_pdf, initial_condition_pdf, backward_encoder, local_encoder, nl_filter, device=cfg.device)


    """lightning"""
    seq_vae = LightningNlbNonlinearSSM(ssm, cfg)

```
